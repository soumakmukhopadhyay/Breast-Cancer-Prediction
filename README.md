This project is about Breast Cancer Prediction and the module theat I have developed here will start with an Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Feature Selection continued with Base Model Development through KFold Cross Validation, Reporting key performance metrics and selecting the best model. Further it involves hyper parameter tuning of the base model in order to prevent over-fitting.
